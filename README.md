This script has been created by Drey for the Association of Demography and Social Statistic Students at OAU. Its purpose is to generate a 6-character alphanumeric code for each student, which they can use to vote for their preferred candidate on election day.

HOW TO USE THE SCRIPT?

1. Create a Google Spreadsheet.
2. The spreadsheet should have columns for ID, Name, Part/Level, and Code.
3. Input the data for all eligible voters, filling in the ID, Name, and Level fields only. The script will automatically generate the corresponding code.
4. Click on "Extensions" and select "Apps Script".
5. In the text editor that appears when you open "Apps Script," copy and paste the code from the script.js file.
6. Save the script and click on "Run" at the top of the text editor.


By following the above steps, you should see a generated code for all students. Please note that each time a new student is added or updated, you will need to rerun the script to ensure that the code is updated for the new student.
